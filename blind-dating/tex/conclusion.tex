\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
In this work we showed that a phylogeny's clock is an invaluable source of information when it comes to dating sequences that are suspected to show latent behavior in patients infected with HIV-1. 
We were able to reliably reconstruct dates non-latent sequences for synthetic and real data, and were able to reliable reconstruct dates for simulated latent data. 

However, these results hinge on the strong assumption of a molecular clock over the data. 
Further work is needed to adapt this method to relaxed clock analysis, which would give more flexibility over noisy or unreliable data. 
Additionally, we would like to apply this methodology to deep-sequence data.
