\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discuss}
The simulated data are unsurprising, the RNA data too. Patient data trends and analysis. Result about rooting, power of data.
We noticed that . When rooting a phylogeny with root-to-tip regession, if the root lies behind the known times, then RTT may fail. Patient 820 shows an example of this.

Qualitatively, latency is very clearly visible in many of the patients. There also seems to be some weird clock behaviour, exhibited in many of the patients but itâ€™s not clear if any of those patterns are statistically significant.
