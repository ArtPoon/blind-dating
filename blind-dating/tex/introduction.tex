\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
Latent viral reservoirs within HIV-1 infected individuals are a major obstacle on the path to cure for HIV \citep{Pace11}. Reservoirs are cells that contain integrated viral DNA but have entered a dormant state that not only has a low output of virus, but can persist for years. Even though antiretroviral therapy (ART) can reduce a patient's virial load to below detectable levels, if a patient stops ART, these latent reservoirs can reseed an infection \citep{Joos08, Pomerantz03, Richman09}.

Not much is known about the timing of the establishment of latent reservoirs during the course of infection. The chronology of the establishment of reservoirs is of interest because the distribution of ages of the stored virus(es) may provide information as to the types of adaptations that the virus may have developed. Specifically, it may have an influence on how those infected cells react to immune-mediate or therapeutic treatments. 

However, there hasn't been much work assigning dates to sequences that are suspected to be latent (there has been work on detecting latent reservoirs \cite{Immonen14}). We propose a simple framework that utilizes the assumption of a strict molecular clock on the evolution of HIV within host -- out method extracts timing information from the phylogenetic relationship between the virus sampled at various time-points along the infection. We first construct a phylogeny for plasma and PBMC samples from a patient, then calibrate a strict clock for that tree based on solely the timing for the plasma sequences. The root of this phylogeny is typically unknown, so we employ either root-to-tip regression, or outgroup rooting to find a candidate root. We assume that PBMC cells are latent, as they contain only integrated cells, and therefore have stopped evolving. We don't try to do any classification of these cells.

Within a chronogram, latency manifests as a difference between a sequence's sampling time and it's predicted sampling time (figure \ref{fig:latenttree}). For sequences that are from the current pool live virus, this assumption is reasonable, however for sequences suspected to be latent, it is not true that the sampling time represents the time at which evolution stops.

Note: need a bridge paragraph here.

To assess the sensitivity of our method, we first simulated sequence data with no latent behavior and evaluated the accuracy of the reconstruction. We then simulated latent behavior under a simplified model of latency \citep{Immonen14}. To mimic the types of results we expected from our first test, we used a previously published set of data to evaluate the reconstruction of dates from only plasma sequences \citep{McCloskey14}. Finally, we tested our methodology on a data-set comprised of patients that had longitudinal samples of both PBMC and plasma sequences.
