\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
Latent viral reservoirs within HIV-1 infected individuals are a major obstacle on the path to cure for HIV \citep{Pace11}. Reservoirs are cells that contain integrated viral DNA but have entered a dormant state in which they not only have a lowered rate of virion production, but can also persist within a patient for several years. Even though highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can reduce a patient's viral load to below detectable levels, if a patient halts treatment latent reservoirs may reseed an infection \citep{Joos08, Pomerantz03, Richman09}.

Due to selective pressures in the host's immune system and HIV's short generation time, HIV evolves very quickly throughout the course of infection \citep{Alizon13, Shankarappa99, Rambaut04}. Once a virus has integrated itself into a cell, the rate at which it accumulates mutations becomes negligible compared to the rate at which the active population in plasma evolves. Phylogenetically, within a chronogram latency manifests as a difference between a sample's collection time and it's predicted collection time (figure \ref{fig:latenttree}). For sequences that are from the active population of virus, this assumption is reasonable.  However for sequences suspected to be latent, it is not true that the sampling time represents the time at which evolution stops.

Not much is known about the establishment of latent reservoirs over the course of an infection. The chronology of their establishment is of interest because the distribution of ages of the stored virus(es) may provide information as to the types of adaptations that the virus may have accumulated. Specifically, it may have an influence on how those infected cells react to immune-mediate or therapeutic treatments. 

Some studies have looked at the population dynamics of different classes of the virus within host, modeled them with systems of ordinary differential equations, then fit that models with empirical data \cite{Althaus14}. There has also been work that attempts to characterize latent sequences using a relaxed clock approach \cite{Immonen14}. However, there hasn't been much work towards assigning dates to sequences that are suspected to be latent, or qualitatively assessing the distribution of collection-age differences for suspected latent samples.

We propose a simple framework that utilizes the assumption of a strict molecular clock (the expected number of substitutions per site is linearly related to time) on the evolution of HIV within host. Our method extracts timing information from the phylogenetic relationship between the virus sampled at various time-points along the infection. We first construct a phylogeny of plasma and PBMC samples from a patient, then calibrate a strict clock to that tree based solely on the collection dates of the plasma sequences. The root of this phylogeny is typically unknown, so we employ either root-to-tip regression or outgroup rooting to find an appropriate root. Further, we assume that PBMC cells are latent, since they contain only integrated viral DNA, and therefore have ``stopped evolving''. We do not explicitly attempt any detection of these cells. 

To assess the sensitivity of our method, we first simulated sequence data with no latent behavior and evaluated the accuracy of the reconstruction. We then simulated and evaluate sequences from a model that exhibits simplified latent behavior  \citep{Immonen14}. To mimic the types of results we expected from our first test, we used a previously published set of data to evaluate the reconstruction of dates from only plasma sequences \citep{McCloskey14}. Finally, we tested our methodology on a data-set comprised of patients that had longitudinal samples of both PBMC and plasma sequences. \anote{clean me ->} If there were pauses in evolution, provided that the molecular clock holds for all the times that the evolution has not stopped, then the clock could be a reliable source of timing for the unknown sequences. At least within the blood compartment, this should be true.

Sequence A was archived at time $t$, yet was collected at the same time as sequence B, at time $t^\prime$, a drift of $t^\prime - t$ is expected. If the molecular clock assumption holds true, then the date at $t$ can be inferred from }
