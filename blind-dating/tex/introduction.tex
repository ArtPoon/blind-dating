\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
Latent viral reservoirs within HIV-1 infected individuals are a major obstacle on the path to cure for HIV \citep{Pace11}. 
Reservoirs are cells that contain integrated viral DNA but have entered a dormant state in which they not only have a lowered rate of virion production, but can also persist within a patient for several years.
Even though highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can reduce a patient's viral load to below detectable levels, latent reservoirs may reseed an infection if a patient halts treatment \citep{Joos08, Pomerantz03, Richman09}.


Due to selective pressures in the host's immune system and HIV's short generation time, HIV evolves very quickly throughout the course of infection \citep{Alizon13, Shankarappa99, Rambaut04}. 
Once a virus has integrated itself into a cell, the rate at which it accumulates mutations becomes negligible compared to the rate at which the active population in plasma evolves. 
Phylogenetically, within a chronogram latency manifests as a difference between a sample's collection time and the expected amount of evolution for a sample of its age (Figure \ref{fig:latenttree}). 
For sequences that are from the active population of virus, this assumption is reasonable because of the clock \citep{}\anote{clock ref}.  However for sequences suspected to be latent, the predicted sampling time represents the time at which evolution effectively stops.

Not much is known about the establishment of latent reservoirs over the course of an infection. 
The chronology of their establishment is of interest because the distribution of ages of the stored virus(es) may provide information as to the types of adaptations that the virus may have accumulated. 
Specifically, it may have an influence on how those infected cells react to immune-mediated and/or therapeutic treatments. 

Some studies have looked at the population dynamics of different classes of the virus within host, modeled those classes with systems of ordinary differential equations, then fit those models to empirical data \citep{Althaus14}. 
There has also been work that attempts to characterize latent sequences using a relaxed clock approach \citep{Immonen14}. 
However, there has not been much work towards assigning dates to sequences that are suspected to be latent, or qualitatively assessing the distribution of collection-age differences for suspected latent samples.

We propose a simple framework that utilizes the assumption of a strict molecular clock -- that the expected number of substitutions per site is linearly related to time \citep{Ho14} --  on the evolution of HIV within host. 
Our method extracts timing information from the phylogenetic relationship between the virus sampled at various time-points along the infection. 
We first construct a phylogeny of plasma and PBMC samples from a patient, then calibrate a strict clock to that tree based solely on the collection dates of the plasma sequences. The root of this phylogeny is typically unknown, so we employ either root-to-tip regression or outgroup rooting to find an appropriate root. 
Further, we assume that PBMC cells are latent, since they contain only integrated viral DNA, and therefore have ``stopped evolving''.

To assess the sensitivity of our method, we first simulated sequence data with no latent behavior and evaluated the accuracy of the reconstruction. 
We then simulated and evaluated sequences from a model that exhibits simplified latent behavior \citep{Immonen14}. To mimic the types of results we expected from our first test, we used a previously published set of data to evaluate the reconstruction of dates from only plasma sequences \citep{McCloskey14}. Finally, we tested our methodology on a data-set comprised of patients that had longitudinal samples of both PBMC and plasma sequences. 
If the molecular clock assumption holds for all sequences, and latency merely implies a ``pause'' in the evolution of a sequence, then the clock should be a reliable source of information for latent sequences.
